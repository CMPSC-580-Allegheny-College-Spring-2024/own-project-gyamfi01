## Introduction

The proposed study uses data science approaches to compare and examine scoring difficulties in basketball over different eras. This study aims to shed light on whether it was harder for players to score points during some eras than during others by examining historical basketball data and using statistical and machine learning approaches. The goal of this research is to better understand how basketball gameplay dynamics have changed over time and how these changes may affect player effectiveness and strategy.

The collection of extensive historical basketball statistics, including player performance measures, team statistics, and game outcomes, from various eras is one of the project's main components. To ensure precision and consistency for further analysis, these data will be cleansed and preprocessed. Combining machine learning algorithms to find patterns and trends in scoring difficulties over time with the computation of scoring data for various eras, including points per game, shooting percentages, and offensive efficiency, will compose the analysis. In order to show scoring trends and make historical comparisons easier, visualizations like graphs and charts will be made.

Fundamental concerns about basketball will be explored by the study, such as whether scoring difficulty significantly changed between the game's early (the 1950s–1990s) and modern (the 2000s–present) periods. Additionally, variables including rule modifications, player skill levels, and defensive tactics that affect scoring difficulties will be examined. The theories driving this research suggest that while player training improvements and strategic breakthroughs have impacted scoring patterns across time, earlier periods' increased scoring difficulty was caused by variations in gameplay styles and defensive tactics.

The goal of this research is to increase appreciation among basketball fans while also advancing our understanding of the historical background and gameplay mechanics of the sport. Basketball fans can develop a deep understanding of the sport's evolution and the efforts that have created its current form by witnessing the difficulties and adaptations players have undergone over the years. The groundwork for a thorough examination of the data analysis, findings, and implications in later sections is laid in this Introduction section.

## Literature Review

TODO (10 source minimum, with 5 of those being published peer-reviewed articles): Conduct literature review by describing relevant work related to the project and hence providing an overview of the state of the art in the area of the project. This section serves to contextualize the study within the existing body of literature, presenting a thorough review of relevant prior research and scholarly contributions. In clear and meaningful language, this section aims to demonstrate the problems, gaps, controversies, or unanswered questions that are associated with the current understanding of the topic. In addition, this section serves to highlight the current study's unique contribution to the field. By summarizing and critiquing existing works, this section provides a foundation for readers to appreciate the novelty and significance of the study in relation to the broader academic discourse. The "Literature Review" section further (in detail) contributes to the `why is the project important?` question.

## Prototype

TODO: Discuss the methods of the project to be able to answer the `how` question (`how was this project completed?`). For this section, you must describe  the methodology behind your implemented prototype. The methods section in an academic research outlines the specific procedures, techniques, and methodologies employed to conduct the study, offering a transparent and replicable framework for the research. It details the resources behind the work, in terms of, for example, the design of the algorithm and the experiment(s), data collection methods, applied software libraries, required tools, the types of statistical analyses and models which are applied to ensure the rigor and validity of the study. This section provides clarity for other researchers to understand and potentially replicate the study, contributing to the overall reliability and credibility of the research findings.

## Preliminary Results and Outcomes

TODO: Discuss the outcomes of your project in this section. Depending on the project type, the presented results and outcomes will vary. In some projects, you will be asked to present a theoretical analysis, and in others your experimental study and its results. In this section, you are also to demonstrate an enhanced version of your artifact by showing its capabilities and applications, in light of the evaluation metrics for assessing the artifact

## Conclusions and Future Work

TODO: Summarize your work and outline future steps needed to complete to take the project to the next stage (for example, if you were to continue with this project in 600/610). You must also address ethical implications of your project, especially as pertains to the public release or use of your software or methods.

## References

TODO: Add references in the [ACM style](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/reference-formatting). All references must be cited in the proposal.
